## Experience

It was a really fulfilling experience to work on this project, as it was my first ever project working with a team. We were able to help one another. For me at least knowing how to use the database and deal with changes to my data was one of the difficulties I encountered. After figuring out the server.js everything started to come together.

The styling was something else I wasn't expecting to enjoy as much as I did. CSS has always been something I struggled with not in syntax but making it aesthetically pleasing, but this time I found it to be more fun than I had thought it would be, maybe because we had enough time to experiment.
Iâ€™m grateful for all learned throughout the project, especially being able to work with both front-end and back-end code all in a group.
