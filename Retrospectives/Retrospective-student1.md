## Experience

It was fun working on this project, especially when in the team setting. We had some really good communication and were able to help each other and build on our progress so that we could all finish
strongly in the end. There were some hurdles for me such as figuring out why editing comments would only 
change the first comment in the list, but eventually I figured out the pug syntax enough to realize that
I was creating every comment with the same ID, so when I sent an edit request it ALWAYS thought I was 
referring to the first comment. There were some great people on StackOverflow that helped me address some
more of my concerns such as how to make my backend code stop giving me errors with the multiple render requests that were present. This got me confused for quite a long time but finding others with similar issues helped me immensely to be able to get
past it and finish the project. The CSS was also more fun than I expected, and I found myself laughing at the pencil cursor I was 
able to put in my home page. And although not beautiful by any means, my comments page was well organized and functional with small
features that help the utility, such as filling in the value field with the current comment when editing - this made it much easier
to change a single thing or two about a comment when editing instead of starting over from blank.
