## Experience

This project has been a valuable learning experience, both in terms of technical skills and team collaboration. The task of building a website for a fictional university allowed me to apply various aspects of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also integrating server-side logic with Node.js. One of the biggest challenges was working with Git in a team environment, especially when it came to managing branches and resolving merge conflicts. However, this process helped improve my version control skills, which will be crucial in future development projects.

The use of Agile methodologies, including simulated stand-up meetings and iterative development, helped maintain a steady pace of progress. Even though the project was done asynchronously, communication was key to keeping everyone on the same page. Our team's ability to collaborate effectively through tools like GitHub and Discord ensured that the project moved forward smoothly.

One of the highlights was creating a dynamic comments section, which required both front-end and back-end work. Integrating a database to store and manipulate comments added an extra layer of complexity but also enhanced the functionality of the website.

In conclusion, this project has been an enriching experience that has not only improved my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving in software development.
